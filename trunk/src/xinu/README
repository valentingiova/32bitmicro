   This directory contains source files for the Xinu Operating System
described in the text Operating System Design -- The XINU Approach
(Prentice Hall, 1983).

   This version of Xinu is for the Intel 486 architecture, and was
ported to the Intel architecture for use in the Xinu Laboratory at
Purdue University.  The Xinu lab has two sets of computers: conventional
workstations running a UNIX operating system, and computers on which
students download and run Xinu.  We call the conventional workstations
'front-end' machines and the other computers 'back-end' machines.  Both
sets are connected to an Ethernet.  In addition, a multiplexor exists
that allows anyone on a front-end machine to connect a window on the screen
to the console serial port of one of the back-end computers.  Finally, a
remote control hardware unit exists that can a front-end user can invoke
to reboot any back-end computer at any time.
